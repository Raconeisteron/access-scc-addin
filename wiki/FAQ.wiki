= Issues with first time use =

== Could not find the object 'MSysAccessStorage' ==
The AddIn uses an Access internal table called MSysAccessStorage to derive some status about local objects. This internal table only came about in Access 2002 version databases, and will not be present in databases prior to 2002.

To encounter this error, you are either:
  # Using Access 2000 or earlier, the addin is only supported from Access XP.
  # You are using Access XP or 2003, but the default setting for the file format is set to create Access 2000 type databases. (This is the default out of the box)

To remedy the second scenario:
  * Open any database using Access
  * Click on Tools -> Options. 
  * Go to the Advanced tab and change the default file format to "Access 2002". 

This will set the default for all new databases.

You will then need to recreate your blank database again and start the import using the addin.
