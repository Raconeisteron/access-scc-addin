To build from source, there must be a working copy already installed.
Make sure to follow the installation guide before performing the following steps. 

 # Check out a copy of the source from svn trunk.
 # Create a new database.
 # Use the Add-In to import objects from directory containing source
 # Remove '-svntmp' suffix from forms created incorrectly - a list of which is shown in the results.
 # Uninstall current version of the Add-In from Tools->Add-Ins->Add-In Manager
 # Close database, change extension from .mdb to .mda so it is recognised as an Add-In.
 # Close any instances of Access.
 # Erase previous version from {{{%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\AddIns}}}.
 # Follow the installation guide with the new mda.
