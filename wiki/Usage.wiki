This will guide you through the steps of managing an Access project using Subversion.

Make sure to follow the installation guide before performing the following steps.

 # Create a folder to use for exporting Access files to text to be imported into Subversion.
 # Run the Add-In (Tools->Add-Ins->Subversion for Access XP).
 # Select the folder you created earlier as the SVN Checkout Folder.
 # Uncheck the "Commit to SVN after export? option.
 # Make sure all objects are selected on the right.

The folder contains your Access database converted into text, which is now imported into Subversion.
